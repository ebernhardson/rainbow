Cirrus Search API usage
=======

When we talk about Cirrus Search usage, what we're really talking about is "full text" search; searching for a particular
term via the API and getting back packages that contain that term in either the title *or* the page's content.

General trends
------

There's not enough data to be able to say much about the patterns inherrent to Cirrus Search usage right now, but it's interesting to compare the values found to how much other search API forms are used. Cirrus sits near the top of the pack; Open Search is used dramatically more, but everything else somewhat (or very much) less.

Outages and inaccuracies
------

* None so far!
