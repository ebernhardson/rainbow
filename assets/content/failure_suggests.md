Zero Rate for Search Suggestions
=======

With a lot of "full-text" searches, the system provides not only results but also suggestions - corrections for typos, for example. These are more prominent with searches that returned few or no results, for fairly obvious reasons (if the suggestion is being provided it's because the system thinks you got something wrong).

This graph shows the zero results rate for full-text searches with suggestions, compared to the zero results rate for full-text searches overall.
