Key Performance Indicators
=======

* **[User Satisfaction](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Measuring_User_Search_Satisfaction)** If a user searches for something and clicks on a result, then they found what they wanted.
* **User-perceived load time** If our search is fast and snappy, then more people will use it! 
* **Zero Results Rate** If a user gets zero results for their query, they’ve by definition not found what they’re looking for.
* **API usage** We want people, both within our movement and outside it, to be able to easily access our information.

Outages and inaccuracies
