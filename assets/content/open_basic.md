OpenSearch API usage
=======

[OpenSearch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSearch) is a search format optimised for syndication and aggregation.
MediaWiki has OpenSearch support, and so does its API; that's what's tracked here. OpenSearch allows you to retrieve
full content as well as snippets, and allows you to *search* full content for your search term.

General trends
------

There's not enough data to be able to say much about the patterns inherrent to OpenSearch usage right now, but it's clear from comparing
the results to other types of search event that OpenSearch is the most commonly used search format.

Outages and inaccuracies

  * None so far!
